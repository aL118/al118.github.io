        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
          I graduated in Spring 2024 with a Master's in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park. However, I am continuing my research into autonomous 
          driving, along with my other interest in autonomous navigation, robotics, and artificial intelligence. For a look at my current work, please see

        <h4>Projects</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Working on autonomous driving research project that leverages sim2real transfer learning to train a model that performs well in both real and virtual environments. Goal is to find the minimum visual transfer necessary to convert simulation images to perceptually-realistic images. Short paper on current work linked above.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Collaborated on a group VR driving project with Laura, Pranav, and other masters students. Aim of this project is to research the possibility of using human personalities to better predict driving behaviour. Current role focuses on gathering training data and compiling driving footage into usable video clips.</p>
